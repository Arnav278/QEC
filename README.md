# QEC
This project explores quantum error correction techniques essential for reliable quantum computation. It involves studying quantum noise, decoherence, and implementing error-correcting codes such as Shor’s and Steane’s codes. By simulating qubit errors and recovery protocols, the project demonstrates how quantum information can be preserved, ensuring fault-tolerant quantum computing.
